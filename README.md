# Capstone-Project
This repository is for storing and sharing Jupyter Notebook code for processing remote sensing data and its associated files

# Instructions:

1. 

Download large files and this repository and relocate the large files to be in the same directory as all the repository files. The 
large files can be downloaded from: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M7cCRRk4DazdLXT_Z_4pbbAW8V5IVcdV?usp=drive_link

2.

All the processed data should be present from all the files so there is no need to run the "LULC as reference". This Jupyter notebook
outputs GeoTiff for the "Analysis - Mapping Dry Season IA in Southesdt Cambodia", which is the main analysis Jupyter notebook.

3.

The ultimatee output is the "Processed - weighted sum area and fractional coverage" which contain the coverage (alpha) or area (km2).
Use the files with "DynamicRef" for the dynamically adjusted reference time series to conduct further analysis.
